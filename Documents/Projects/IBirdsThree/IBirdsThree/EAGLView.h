     File: EAGLView.h
 Abstract: This class wraps the CAEAGLLayer from CoreAnimation into a convenient
 UIView subclass. The view content is basically an EAGL surface you render your
 OpenGL scene into.  Note that setting the view non-opaque will only work if the
 EAGL surface has an alpha channel.
