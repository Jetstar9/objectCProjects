I explain to my students that a lot of three-putts occur because the person has trouble controlling the speed on the first putt. A drill that I use to practice speed control starts with creating an 18-inch-wide box by placing tees in the putting green, then asking the student to hit five putts into the box from 10 feet. After that we move back to 15 feet, then 20 feet and 25 feet. This helps to develop a consistent pace and distance control. Then we practice short putts that can be missed and lead to three-putts. Once the student makes 10 in a row from two feet, we move back to three feet and so on. This helps to build confidence and gives them a better feel hitting these short putts. Rather than having them spend an hour hitting their drivers, we take 40 minutes working on putting. If we practice these drills twice and the student plays a round that weekend, the number of three-putts typically decrease from three or four to one or zero after just one week of work.
Mike Carbray on the business impact of eliminating students’ three-putts: When the students see the results and lower their scores, they will trust in your ability and come back for more in-depth putting lessons. Once a couple of students improve their putting, word spreads like wildfire around the club. This word-of-mouth advertising for my putting lessons helps other members to see their importance and leads to an increase in revenue.
