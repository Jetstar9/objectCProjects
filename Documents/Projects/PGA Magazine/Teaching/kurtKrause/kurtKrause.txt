We do not have a range at El Camino Country Club, which can make it difficult to conduct golf lessons. To work around this, I provide lessons on the golf course without interfering with regular play. Too often, amateur golfers simply hit ball after ball on a driving range without defining an area at which they are aiming, which can create a false sense of security. By giving a lesson on the course, the student gets to see the ball land in a fairway or in the rough, which is much more realistic. All it takes to provide these types of lessons is a little creativity and dedication. One of the ways I do this, when the course is fairly busy, is by choosing an area on the course that is guarded by trees; the student will hit balls to a fairway in between groups coming through. Another way I teach on the course is to schedule lessons during times when the course is less busy. For example, I know that I can conduct lessons at the 18th hole first thing in the morning, as golfers have not yet reached this area of the course. When teaching on course, it’s important to take care of the golf course by changing locations often. Also, when playing shots toward a green I try to play from about 20 farther yards back than the distance the player normally hits a club. This way, most balls land just short and thus it is not necessary to fix a multitude of ball marks on the green.
Kurt Krause on the business impact of using the golf course during lessons: Some facilities without a range have students hit into nets, but this can turn people off. They want to see the ball flight instead of using a launch monitor or going by feel. Nearly 100 percent of my lessons take place on our golf course, and the students love it. Without this, my lesson revenue would suffer greatly. On-course lessons are a great way to teach students the game, especially for a facility that does not have a range.
