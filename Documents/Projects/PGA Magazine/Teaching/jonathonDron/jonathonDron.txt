I teach at both an indoor/outdoor facility, which is great because it allows me to be outdoors in the summer and indoors in the winter, meaning year-round employment. However, the winter months tend to be a bit slower than the warmer months. As a result, I want to make my lesson packages as attractive as possible so I can have a consistent cash flow throughout the year. My most popular package is the Birdie Package. Students receive two 45-minute lessons, one 30-minute practice session on our PGA Tour Simulator and five buckets of balls for $135 each month. Students sign up for a duration of time, three months being the minimum, and they are billed on a monthly basis instead of paying a large upfront fee. The benefit of doing this is that my students don’t feel rushed to complete a lesson package in a short timeframe, and it is financially easier for them to make monthly payments. It also allows me a more predictable revenue stream. When they fill out their package application, they also have the option to increase the number of lessons, lesson duration, or the number of range balls. This increases their monthly fee, but allows their package to be customized to their needs.
Jonathan Dron on the importance of packaging lessons and range time: Since beginning this new program, retention has improved as I am staying in front of my clients more often at regular intervals. This has allowed my revenue to increase approximately 25 percent during the winter months and 15 percent in the warmer months. I now have a more consistent monthly cash flow, which helps reduce my stress during slow periods. For my students it is a win-win situation because they are able to pay monthly, and they receive not only instruction but also practice time as well.
