As a golf instructor, things have changed quite a bit in the last 20 years. We’re still trying to get the student to hit the ball straight, but with the advancements in technology, we now have even more vehicles to succeed. For communication with students, text messaging can be a useful tool for quick messages. Following a lesson, I will send a quick summary of the main points that we covered. This helps because they can take their phone with them to the range and have the notes readily available at any time. I will also send a quick reminder of the time and date of their next lesson. Another way I use texting is to wish them luck before a tournament. A lot times when students talk to me and they reference an important upcoming date, I will jot down a note so that I can add it to my calendar to send them a text later. It’s important as a teacher to be organized in this way, because if I’m dealing with a lot of people I probably won’t remember otherwise. Whether it’s before a member-guest or a club championship, a simple message means a whole lot to a student. This outing could be their Masters Tournament, and what may not seem significant to someone else can mean a lot to them.
John Spina on the business impact of text messaging students: If you’re not using text messaging, you might be at a disadvantage. This is another way to interact with your students to show that you’re interested in their development and success as a golfer. When they see the text, they get a better idea that you truly care. It doesn’t take a long time to type a short text, and it can go a long way. The goal is to help players get better, but I also want them to feel special. If I do both of those things, they are more likely to stay with me as their golf instructor. For those students you have not seen in a while, your name is back on their radar, and a simple text that takes 30 seconds to send can turn into another lesson.
