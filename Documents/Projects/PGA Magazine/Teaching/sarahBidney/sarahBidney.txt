This fall at Sugar Creek, I offered a girls-only Short Game Improvement Program. I was approached by the local high school girls golf coach about the program, as he felt this was an area of the game with which his players needed assistance. He got information to his players about the program, and we even invited a handful of middle school girls to participate. The focus is strictly pitching down to putting. We won’t pull a driver the entire six weeks of the program. Our goal is to improve short game technique and, more importantly, improve their shot selection and decision-making on the course. Even though they may like to pull their sand wedge and play a high flop shot every time, the goal of the program is to help them understand which shot is best based on the situation they’re facing. While this was a junior girls-only program, I feel the format would fit well with high school boys and adults. In other programs and lessons I focus on the short game, but many golfers, especially juniors, don’t give enough attention to the short game on their own. Everyone loves to bang drivers on the range for 30 minutes, but as we all know, the short game is crucial to lowering scores. This program highlights the importance of the short game to scoring, and I’m certain these players will see improvements in their game.
Sarah Bidney on the business impact of short game-only schools:  The program cost $175 for six 90-minute sessions, which was affordable to the participants. The added revenue is particularly great as private lessons start to dwindle in the fall in Iowa. Besides the gain in revenue, the other important lesson is to keep in touch with local coaches to get a pulse on their teams and needs. This program was simple to implement, the girls are benefiting from the instruction, and the coach is elated to have such a great working relationship with myself and the staff at Sugar Creek.
