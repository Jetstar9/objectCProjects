Susan Roll on the importance of finding new technologies to aid instruction: At this year’s PGA Merchandise Show, one area in which I plan to focus my efforts is to find the latest technology I can put to use in various aspects of my facility. I’m looking for golf-specific applications for common-use technology, such as Apple’s iPod touch and iPad. These devices are user-friendly tools we regularly employ in lessons and clubfitting sessions. I hope to find more ways to use them, as I’m sure there are new applications available. Last year we had a lot of buzz around the iPing putter app, and I hope to find other companies doing something similar. I am also excited to see the latest clubfitting technology, including Adams Golf’s new fitting program that includes gap fitting recommendations. This is exactly what golfers are looking for when they come to us. There are a lot of useful ways to apply technology that we just don’t know about because they are from companies we don’t see on a regular basis. Using the Show to find these tools makes me a better clubfitter, instructor and business owner.
Susan Roll on the business impact of finding new technologies to aid instruction: Having the latest technology to help golfers play better is important to our business going forward. It’s our job to not only bring golfers to the game, but to retain them. Utilizing technology to relate to students shows that we are on the cutting edge when it comes to golf instruction, which increases our credibility and repeat lesson revenue. Advanced clubfitting technology increases our effectiveness, which brings more revenue to this area of our business. Smartphone applications can also have a positive effect on golf shop sales, as we’ve sold hundreds of the iPhone cradles for the iPing app.
